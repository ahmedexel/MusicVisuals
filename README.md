Name: Ahmed Alsaleh, Malek Tumi, Riley Hogarty

Student Number: C20439752, C20426892, D20124835

## Instructions
- Fork this repository and use it a starter project for your assignment
- Create a new package named your student number and put all your code in this package.
- You should start by creating a subclass of ie.tudublin.Visual
- There is an example visualiser called MyVisual in the example package
- Check out the WaveForm and AudioBandsVisual for examples of how to call the Processing functions from other classes that are not subclasses of PApplet

# Description of the assignment


This is a visual program that uses ac dc touch too much to create a reactive image.

We split the creating of the program into individual parts so that each one of us had an input the project. 
- Malek created the disco-ball refining the standards.
- Riley added the stickman emblishing the aesthetics.
- Ahmed implemented the speakers building a solid a foundation. 
Therefore we have all worked on this great project .

Upon reflectong on the project we believe there was room for improvement
1. Time management was mas a massive hindrance to us as we delayed working on this project for time.
1. We all genuiniely believe that if we were diligant we would have did better.
1. There were many additional features we wanted to add such as a background image, extra reactive elements.
1. The Overall aesthetics of the visuals is good but there's a scope for improvement.


# Instructions
run Main.java
# How it works

# What I am most proud of in the 

The final product was our proudest part mainly because it was a relief get the project done.
Finishing the project sufficed as a major factor for delaying the project as it seemed extremely difficult at first.

However breaking down the project into simpler parts our proudest part were:-
- Malek favoured the disco-ball and found them the most appealing.
- Riley selected  the stickman and thought was the most intriguing.
- Ahmed went for the speakers and considered them the most important part.

There is biasness in our choices as we all chose what we individually implemented.

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
